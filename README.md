## Hey There ðŸ˜Ž
I'm Gabriel Godwin. 

I am a software engineer that blends data and design with Engineering. I am involved in all stages and all areas of software development as well as architecture design, performance evaluation, code review, and internal tool management. I am currently partnering with like-minded individuals to build a sustainable startup. In my spare time, I engage in community-building/activities. 

Feel free to reach out to me via email if you have the next idea about what would change the world or simply want us to go over something you worked on or maybe you just want us to ideate: o.gabrielgodwin@gmail.com
