## Hey There üòé
I'm Gabriel Godwin. 

I am a front-end engineer that blends data and design with Engineering. I use a Component-Driven Development (CDD) methodology to build UIs. The CDD approach is a process that builds UIs from the ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù, starting with components and ending with screens. CDD helps us scale the amount of complexity we are faced with as we build out the UI. Among other things I enjoy building design systems and currently mentoring new frontend engineers on frontendmentor.io
