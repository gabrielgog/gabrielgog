## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Gabriel, a product minded software engineer that blends data and design with engineering. I have a passion for Design Systems, Data Science and Serverless Technologies such as Amazon Web services and the Google Cloud plattform. Apart from writing code I enjoy technical writting and currently practicing opensource contribution.
