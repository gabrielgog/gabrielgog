## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Gabriel, a product-minded software engineer that blends data & design with engineering. I specialize in Javascript and work primarily with React and Firebase, but I have experience working in a wide range of technologies including Node and Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Flutter, REST API design, third party APIs and AWS.

Additionally, I am technical writer interested in UX design and open source contributions.
